# Goal

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of traffic congestion in the Athens city center using millions of vehicle trajectories extracted from drone videos.

Specifically, we aim to address the following research questions:
1. Identifying the busiest areas.
2. Determining the most efficient ways to navigate the city.
3. Analyzing how road features impact traffic congestion.

Following data preparation, which involves transitioning from road trajectories to a weighted graph, we present the following results:
1. Traffic Maps: we provide visual representations of road congestion percentages using various colors.
2. Shortest Paths: we offer insights into the most efficient routes between different points within the city.
3. Speed Trends and Traffic Light Locations: we identify road features, such as traffic lights, and analyze speed trends using trajectory functional data.
