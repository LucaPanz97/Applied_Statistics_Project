# Applied_Statistics_Project

# Goal

The goal of this project is to conduct a comprehensive study of traffic congestion in the Athens city center using millions of vehicle trajectories extracted from drone videos.

Specifically, we aim to answer the following research questions:
1. Which are the busiest areas?
2. What is the best way to move around the city?
3. How do road features affect traffic congestion?

After a data preparation based on the transition from road trajectories to a weighted graph, we provide the following results:
1. Traffic Maps: we present traffic maps indicating the percentage of road congestion using different colors
2. Shortest Paths: we offer insights into the shortest path from one point to another within the city
